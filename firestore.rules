/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Trek Explorer Accounts.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for account data. Each user can only
 * access their own account information, preventing unauthorized access to other users' data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * User account data is stored in the `/accounts/{accountId}` collection, where `{accountId}`
 * corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID of the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own account documents.
 * - Listing all accounts is not permitted to prevent information disclosure.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  Not Required. The `accountId` path parameter inherently links the document to the user's UID.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  All account information is stored under the `/accounts/{accountId}` path, ensuring clear
 *  separation and ownership.
