/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for account data. Each user can only
 * access their own account information.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 * All account data is stored under the `/accounts/{accountId}` path, where `{accountId}`
 * corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID of the user.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - The `id` field within the `/accounts/{accountId}` document must match the `accountId`
 *   in the path. This is enforced on creation and immutability is enforced on updates.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `id` field is used to denormalize the user's UID directly onto the account document.
 * This allows for efficient ownership checks without requiring additional `get()` calls.

     * @allow (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user can get, update, or delete their own account if the accountId matches their UID and the document exists.
     * @deny (create) - User attempts to create an account with an ID that doesn't match their UID.
     * @deny (get, update, delete) - User attempts to get, update, or delete an account that doesn't belong to them.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations, ensuring users can only manage their own account data.
