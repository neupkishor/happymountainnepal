/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for account data.
 *   Each user can only access their own account information. No listing of accounts is allowed.
 * @data_structure All user data is stored under the `/accounts/{accountId}` path, where `{accountId}`
 *   must match the Firebase Auth UID of the user.
 * @key_security_decisions User accounts are private and cannot be listed. Only the authenticated user
 *   can read or write their own account data.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization The `accountId` is implicitly denormalized because it is enforced
 *   that the document ID in `/accounts/{accountId}` must match the `request.auth.uid`.
 * @structural_segregation N/A
